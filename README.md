# QuizIt
QuizIt is an app allowing you to create quizs, play them with you friends and (in a near future) share and edit them together with who you want!

The initial purpose of the app was to share some good memories with you friend together in the same place, that said it will allow you to play with others in the same room. It is not able to play remotely over the internet.

## How to use it
### Create a quiz
To set up a new quiz it's simple, give it a title, add some questions, either a question with 4 text answers or a question with a bunch of pictures where you have to choose which picture is the right answer.
